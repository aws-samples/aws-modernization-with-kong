This template is mostly "plug and play", but you will need to download [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/getting-started/installing/) for your OS (Windows, Linux, Mac) to develop your content locally. Note that the workshop.aws build process uses [Hugo 0.74.3](https://github.com/gohugoio/hugo/releases/tag/v0.74.3) so installing that version will mean your local testing is in line with the production build system

When you are ready to publish the content, open a workshops.aws publication SIM ticket: [https://w.amazon.com/bin/view/AWS/Teams/SA/Customer_Engagements/workshops](https://w.amazon.com/bin/view/AWS/Teams/SA/Customer_Engagements/workshops).
